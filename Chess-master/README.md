# Chess 

C# Chess Game that enables a user to play chess against the computer. Developed using C# (C Sharp) and the Microsoft DotNet framework.

It plays a challenging, and I'm told "fun", tactical game of chess. 

I'd like to improve the computational speed and overall playing strength of the engine by getting other developers to contribute to the project.

### Programming Featues
--------------------
A well-designed, and hopefully easy-to-understand, object-model that will enable other developers to quickly get involved in the project.

### Game Features
--------------
Play the against computer opponent
Graphical chess board
Helpful high-lighting of legal chess moves are when clicking on a piece
Real-time chess clocks
Move history displayed
Load/Save chess games during play
Undo/Redo moves
See real-time computer thinking
See post-analysis tree of all moves considered by computer
Stalemate and 3-move repetition detection

### Chess engine features
---------------------

Alpha-Beta search with Pricipal-variation (PVS)
Iterative Deepening
Hashtable (transition) using Zobrist Keys
Null-move forward pruning (verified and non-verified)
0x88 board representation
Move ordering using Hash table and History Heuristic
Quiescience Search with (MVV/LVA and SEE)
Search Extensions (Check, Re-Capture, Pawn-promotion)
Futility pruning (Standard & Extended)
"n moves in x minutes" Move time-allocation algorithm
